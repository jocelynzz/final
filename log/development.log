Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:\r\n\r\n10) I’m hurt – If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat’s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn’t typical. “Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,” advises Web MD.\r\n\r\n9) I’m just saying hi – Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.\r\n\r\n8) I want food – The “I’m hungry” meow is likely one all cat parents know well. “Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it’s time for dinner,” says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. “My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.”\r\n\r\n7) Pay attention to me – Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention – and they learn that meowing gets them just that. “Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,” explains Web MD.\r\n\r\n6) Let me in - “If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,” says Harrell. “I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn’t want to come in – she just doesn’t like having it closed.”\r\n\r\n5) I’m in heat – A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. “Another good reason for spaying!” she adds.\r\n\r\n4) I’m stressed – According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.\r\n\r\n3) I’m ticked off – “Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,” says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.\r\n\r\n2) I don’t want to be alone – According to The Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine’s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.\r\n\r\n1) I’m getting older – “Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,” says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.\r\n\r\nOf course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings.  Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better."}

According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, “cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.”

So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:

10) I’m hurt – If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat’s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn’t typical. “Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,” advises Web MD.

9) I’m just saying hi – Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.

8) I want food – The “I’m hungry” meow is likely one all cat parents know well. “Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it’s time for dinner,” says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. “My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.”

7) Pay attention to me – Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention – and they learn that meowing gets them just that. “Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,” explains Web MD.

6) Let me in - “If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,” says Harrell. “I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn’t want to come in – she just doesn’t like having it closed.”

5) I’m in heat – A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. “Another good reason for spaying!” she adds.

4) I’m stressed – According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.

3) I’m ticked off – “Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,” says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.

2) I don’t want to be alone – According to The Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine’s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.

1) I’m getting older – “Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,” says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.

Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings.  Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.', 22, '2015-05-26 03:35:24.822927')[0m

According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, “cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.”

So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:

10) I’m hurt – If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat’s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn’t typical. “Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,” advises Web MD.

9) I’m just saying hi – Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.

8) I want food – The “I’m hungry” meow is likely one all cat parents know well. “Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it’s time for dinner,” says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. “My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.”

7) Pay attention to me – Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention – and they learn that meowing gets them just that. “Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,” explains Web MD.

6) Let me in - “If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,” says Harrell. “I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn’t want to come in – she just doesn’t like having it closed.”

5) I’m in heat – A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. “Another good reason for spaying!” she adds.

4) I’m stressed – According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.

3) I’m ticked off – “Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,” says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.

2) I don’t want to be alone – According to The Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine’s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.

1) I’m getting older – “Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,” says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.

Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings.  Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.', 22, '2015-05-26 03:35:24.822927')[0m

According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, “cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.”

So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:

10) I’m hurt – If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat’s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn’t typical. “Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,” advises Web MD.

9) I’m just saying hi – Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.

8) I want food – The “I’m hungry” meow is likely one all cat parents know well. “Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it’s time for dinner,” says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. “My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.”

7) Pay attention to me – Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention – and they learn that meowing gets them just that. “Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,” explains Web MD.

6) Let me in - “If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,” says Harrell. “I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn’t want to come in – she just doesn’t like having it closed.”

5) I’m in heat – A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. “Another good reason for spaying!” she adds.

4) I’m stressed – According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.

3) I’m ticked off – “Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,” says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.

2) I don’t want to be alone – According to The Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine’s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.

1) I’m getting older – “Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,” says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.

Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings.  Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.', 22, '2015-05-26 03:35:24.822927')[0m

According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, “cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.”

So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:

10) I’m hurt – If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat’s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn’t typical. “Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,” advises Web MD.

9) I’m just saying hi – Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.

8) I want food – The “I’m hungry” meow is likely one all cat parents know well. “Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it’s time for dinner,” says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. “My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.”

7) Pay attention to me – Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention – and they learn that meowing gets them just that. “Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,” explains Web MD.

6) Let me in - “If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,” says Harrell. “I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn’t want to come in – she just doesn’t like having it closed.”

5) I’m in heat – A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. “Another good reason for spaying!” she adds.

4) I’m stressed – According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.

3) I’m ticked off – “Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,” says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.

2) I don’t want to be alone – According to The Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine’s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.

1) I’m getting older – “Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,” says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.

Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings.  Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.', 22, '2015-05-26 03:35:24.822927')[0m

According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, “cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.”

So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:

10) I’m hurt – If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat’s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn’t typical. “Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,” advises Web MD.

9) I’m just saying hi – Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.

8) I want food – The “I’m hungry” meow is likely one all cat parents know well. “Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it’s time for dinner,” says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. “My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.”

7) Pay attention to me – Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention – and they learn that meowing gets them just that. “Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,” explains Web MD.

6) Let me in - “If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,” says Harrell. “I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn’t want to come in – she just doesn’t like having it closed.”

5) I’m in heat – A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. “Another good reason for spaying!” she adds.

4) I’m stressed – According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.

3) I’m ticked off – “Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,” says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.

2) I don’t want to be alone – According to The Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine’s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.

1) I’m getting older – “Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,” says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.

Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings.  Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.', 22, '2015-05-26 03:35:24.822927')[0m

According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, “cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.”

So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:

10) I’m hurt – If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat’s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn’t typical. “Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,” advises Web MD.

9) I’m just saying hi – Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.

8) I want food – The “I’m hungry” meow is likely one all cat parents know well. “Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it’s time for dinner,” says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. “My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.”

7) Pay attention to me – Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention – and they learn that meowing gets them just that. “Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,” explains Web MD.

6) Let me in - “If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,” says Harrell. “I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn’t want to come in – she just doesn’t like having it closed.”

5) I’m in heat – A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. “Another good reason for spaying!” she adds.

4) I’m stressed – According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.

3) I’m ticked off – “Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,” says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.

2) I don’t want to be alone – According to The Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine’s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.

1) I’m getting older – “Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,” says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.

Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings.  Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.', 22, '2015-05-26 03:35:24.822927')[0m

According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, “cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.”

So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:

10) I’m hurt – If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat’s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn’t typical. “Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,” advises Web MD.

9) I’m just saying hi – Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.

8) I want food – The “I’m hungry” meow is likely one all cat parents know well. “Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it’s time for dinner,” says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. “My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.”

7) Pay attention to me – Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention – and they learn that meowing gets them just that. “Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,” explains Web MD.

6) Let me in - “If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,” says Harrell. “I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn’t want to come in – she just doesn’t like having it closed.”

5) I’m in heat – A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. “Another good reason for spaying!” she adds.

4) I’m stressed – According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.

3) I’m ticked off – “Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,” says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.

2) I don’t want to be alone – According to The Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine’s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.

1) I’m getting older – “Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,” says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.

Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings.  Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.', 22, '2015-05-26 03:35:24.822927')[0m

7) Pay attention to me – Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention – and they learn that meowing gets them just that. “Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,” explains Web MD.

6) Let me in - “If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,” says Harrell. “I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn’t want to come in – she just doesn’t like having it closed.”

5) I’m in heat – A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. “Another good reason for spaying!” she adds.

4) I’m stressed – According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.

3) I’m ticked off – “Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,” says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.

2) I don’t want to be alone – According to The Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine’s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.

1) I’m getting older – “Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,” says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.

Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings.  Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.', 22, '2015-05-26 03:35:24.822927')[0m

Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:</p>\r\n<p>10) I&rsquo;m hurt &ndash; If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat&rsquo;s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn&rsquo;t typical. &ldquo;Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,&rdquo; advises Web MD.</p>\r\n<p>9) I&rsquo;m just saying hi &ndash; Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"http://www.folksdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cute-cats-and-kittens-meowing-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"199\" />&nbsp;8) I want food &ndash; The &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry&rdquo; meow is likely one all cat parents know well. &ldquo;Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it&rsquo;s time for dinner,&rdquo; says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. &ldquo;My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;7) Pay attention to me &ndash; Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention &ndash; and they learn that meowing gets them just that. &ldquo;Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,&rdquo; explains Web MD.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;6) Let me in - &ldquo;If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,&rdquo; says Harrell. &ldquo;I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn&rsquo;t want to come in &ndash; she just doesn&rsquo;t like having it closed.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;5) I&rsquo;m in heat &ndash; A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. &ldquo;Another good reason for spaying!&rdquo; she adds.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;4) I&rsquo;m stressed &ndash; According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;3) I&rsquo;m ticked off &ndash; &ldquo;Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,&rdquo; says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.</p>\r\n<p>2) I don&rsquo;t want to be alone &ndash; According to The Ohio State University&rsquo;s College of Veterinary Medicine&rsquo;s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.</p>\r\n<p>1) I&rsquo;m getting older &ndash; &ldquo;Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,&rdquo; says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings. Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.</p>", "id"=>"13"}

Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:</p>\r\n<p>10) I&rsquo;m hurt &ndash; If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat&rsquo;s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn&rsquo;t typical. &ldquo;Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,&rdquo; advises Web MD.</p>\r\n<p>9) I&rsquo;m just saying hi &ndash; Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.</p>\r\n<p>8) I want food &ndash; The &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry&rdquo; meow is likely one all cat parents know well. &ldquo;Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it&rsquo;s time for dinner,&rdquo; says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. &ldquo;My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>7) Pay attention to me &ndash; Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention &ndash; and they learn that meowing gets them just that. &ldquo;Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,&rdquo; explains Web MD.</p>\r\n<p>6) Let me in - &ldquo;If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,&rdquo; says Harrell. &ldquo;I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn&rsquo;t want to come in &ndash; she just doesn&rsquo;t like having it closed.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>5) I&rsquo;m in heat &ndash; A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. &ldquo;Another good reason for spaying!&rdquo; she adds.</p>\r\n<p>4) I&rsquo;m stressed &ndash; According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.</p>\r\n<p>3) I&rsquo;m ticked off &ndash; &ldquo;Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,&rdquo; says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.</p>\r\n<p>2) I don&rsquo;t want to be alone &ndash; According to The Ohio State University&rsquo;s College of Veterinary Medicine&rsquo;s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.</p>\r\n<p>1) I&rsquo;m getting older &ndash; &ldquo;Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,&rdquo; says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings. Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.</p>", "id"=>"13"}

Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:</p>\r\n<p>10) I&rsquo;m hurt &ndash; If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat&rsquo;s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn&rsquo;t typical. &ldquo;Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,&rdquo; advises Web MD.</p>\r\n<p>9) I&rsquo;m just saying hi &ndash; Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.</p>\r\n<p>8) I want food &ndash; The &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry&rdquo; meow is likely one all cat parents know well. &ldquo;Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it&rsquo;s time for dinner,&rdquo; says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. &ldquo;My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>7) Pay attention to me &ndash; Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention &ndash; and they learn that meowing gets them just that. &ldquo;Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,&rdquo; explains Web MD.</p>\r\n<p>6) Let me in - &ldquo;If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,&rdquo; says Harrell. &ldquo;I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn&rsquo;t want to come in &ndash; she just doesn&rsquo;t like having it closed.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>5) I&rsquo;m in heat &ndash; A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. &ldquo;Another good reason for spaying!&rdquo; she adds.</p>\r\n<p>4) I&rsquo;m stressed &ndash; According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.</p>\r\n<p>3) I&rsquo;m ticked off &ndash; &ldquo;Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,&rdquo; says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.</p>\r\n<p>2) I don&rsquo;t want to be alone &ndash; According to The Ohio State University&rsquo;s College of Veterinary Medicine&rsquo;s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.</p>\r\n<p>1) I&rsquo;m getting older &ndash; &ldquo;Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,&rdquo; says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings. Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.</p>", "id"=>"13"}

According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, “cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.”

So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:

10) I’m hurt – If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat’s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn’t typical. “Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,” advises Web MD.

9) I’m just saying hi – Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.

8) I want food – The “I’m hungry” meow is likely one all cat parents know well. “Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it’s time for dinner,” says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. “My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.”

7) Pay attention to me – Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention – and they learn that meowing gets them just that. “Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,” explains Web MD.

6) Let me in - “If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,” says Harrell. “I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn’t want to come in – she just doesn’t like having it closed.”

5) I’m in heat – A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. “Another good reason for spaying!” she adds.

4) I’m stressed – According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.

3) I’m ticked off – “Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,” says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.

2) I don’t want to be alone – According to The Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine’s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.

1) I’m getting older – “Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,” says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.

Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings.  Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.', 22, '2015-05-26 03:35:24.822927')[0m

According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, “cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.”

So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:

10) I’m hurt – If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat’s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn’t typical. “Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,” advises Web MD.

9) I’m just saying hi – Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.

8) I want food – The “I’m hungry” meow is likely one all cat parents know well. “Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it’s time for dinner,” says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. “My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.”

7) Pay attention to me – Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention – and they learn that meowing gets them just that. “Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,” explains Web MD.

6) Let me in - “If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,” says Harrell. “I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn’t want to come in – she just doesn’t like having it closed.”

5) I’m in heat – A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. “Another good reason for spaying!” she adds.

4) I’m stressed – According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.

3) I’m ticked off – “Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,” says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.

2) I don’t want to be alone – According to The Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine’s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.

1) I’m getting older – “Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,” says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.

Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings.  Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.', 22, '2015-05-26 03:35:24.822927')[0m

According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, “cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.”

So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:

10) I’m hurt – If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat’s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn’t typical. “Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,” advises Web MD.

9) I’m just saying hi – Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.

8) I want food – The “I’m hungry” meow is likely one all cat parents know well. “Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it’s time for dinner,” says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. “My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.”

7) Pay attention to me – Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention – and they learn that meowing gets them just that. “Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,” explains Web MD.

6) Let me in - “If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,” says Harrell. “I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn’t want to come in – she just doesn’t like having it closed.”

5) I’m in heat – A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. “Another good reason for spaying!” she adds.

4) I’m stressed – According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.

3) I’m ticked off – “Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,” says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.

2) I don’t want to be alone – According to The Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine’s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.

1) I’m getting older – “Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,” says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.

Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings.  Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.', 22, '2015-05-26 03:35:24.822927')[0m

<p>According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, &ldquo;cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:</p>
<p>10) I&rsquo;m hurt &ndash; If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat&rsquo;s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn&rsquo;t typical. &ldquo;Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,&rdquo; advises Web MD.</p>
<p>9) I&rsquo;m just saying hi &ndash; Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.<img style="float: left;" src="http://www.clker.com/cliparts/f/2/c/4/1362609953990473477kitten%2011.jpg" alt="meowing" width="250" height="249" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;8) I want food &ndash; The &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry&rdquo; meow is likely one all cat parents know well. &ldquo;Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it&rsquo;s time for dinner,&rdquo; says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. &ldquo;My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;7) Pay attention to me &ndash; Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention &ndash; and they learn that meowing gets them just that. &ldquo;Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,&rdquo; explains Web MD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;6) Let me in - &ldquo;If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,&rdquo; says Harrell. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn&rsquo;t want to come in &ndash; she just doesn&rsquo;t like having it closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;5) I&rsquo;m in heat &ndash; A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. &ldquo;Another good reason for spaying!&rdquo; she adds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4) I&rsquo;m stressed &ndash; According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.</p>
<p>3) I&rsquo;m ticked off &ndash; &ldquo;Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,&rdquo; says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.</p>
<p>2) I don&rsquo;t want to be alone &ndash; According to The Ohio State University&rsquo;s College of Veterinary Medicine&rsquo;s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.</p>
<p>1) I&rsquo;m getting older &ndash; &ldquo;Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,&rdquo; says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.</p>
<p>Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings. Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.</p>', 22, '2015-05-30 23:28:48.000000')[0m

AND THEIR SHORT-TERM MEMORIES ARE PRETTY GOOD&mdash;UNDER THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES.</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: ''comic sans ms'', sans-serif;">Short-term memories typically fade away in about a minute, but in a study published in<em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">Current Biology</em>&nbsp;in 2007, scientists determined that cats'' short-term memory of certain things lasts 10 minutes. The scientists tested it by stopping cats after their forelegs, but not their hindlegs, had cleared an obstacle. They distracted the cat with food and then waited to see how long the cats would remember having stepped over the obstacle. The cats remembered for about 10 minutes and would&nbsp;<a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #04bfc3; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/08/21/cats-short-term-memory-lasts-about-10-minutes/" target="_blank">bring their hind legs up where they remembered an obstacle</a>, even if it had been removed.</span></p>

"We''ve found that the long-lasting memory for guiding hind legs over an obstacle requires stepping of the forelegs over the obstacle," researcher Keir Pearson of the University of Alberta in Canada said. "The main surprise was how short lasting the visual memory on its own was&mdash;just a few seconds when animals were stopped before their forelegs stepped over the obstacle."</span></p>

"Our data suggest that cats were attracted to ancient farming villages by small animals, such as rodents that were living on the grain that the farmers grew, ate and stored," says Fiona Marshall, study co-author and archaeology professor at Washington University in St. Louis. "Results of this study show that the village of Quanhucun was a source of food for the cats 5300 years ago, and the relationship between humans and cats was commensal, or advantageous for the cats. Even if these cats were not yet domesticated, our evidence confirms that they lived in close proximity to farmers, and that the relationship had mutual benefits."</span></span></p>

<p>According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, &ldquo;cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:</p>
<p>10) I&rsquo;m hurt &ndash; If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat&rsquo;s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn&rsquo;t typical. &ldquo;Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,&rdquo; advises Web MD.</p>
<p>9) I&rsquo;m just saying hi &ndash; Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.<img style="float: left;" src="http://www.clker.com/cliparts/f/2/c/4/1362609953990473477kitten%2011.jpg" alt="meowing" width="250" height="249" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;8) I want food &ndash; The &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry&rdquo; meow is likely one all cat parents know well. &ldquo;Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it&rsquo;s time for dinner,&rdquo; says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. &ldquo;My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;7) Pay attention to me &ndash; Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention &ndash; and they learn that meowing gets them just that. &ldquo;Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,&rdquo; explains Web MD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;6) Let me in - &ldquo;If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,&rdquo; says Harrell. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn&rsquo;t want to come in &ndash; she just doesn&rsquo;t like having it closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;5) I&rsquo;m in heat &ndash; A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. &ldquo;Another good reason for spaying!&rdquo; she adds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4) I&rsquo;m stressed &ndash; According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.</p>
<p>3) I&rsquo;m ticked off &ndash; &ldquo;Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,&rdquo; says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.</p>
<p>2) I don&rsquo;t want to be alone &ndash; According to The Ohio State University&rsquo;s College of Veterinary Medicine&rsquo;s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.</p>
<p>1) I&rsquo;m getting older &ndash; &ldquo;Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,&rdquo; says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.</p>
<p>Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings. Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.</p>', 22, '2015-05-30 23:28:48.000000')

AND THEIR SHORT-TERM MEMORIES ARE PRETTY GOOD&mdash;UNDER THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES.</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: ''comic sans ms'', sans-serif;">Short-term memories typically fade away in about a minute, but in a study published in<em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">Current Biology</em>&nbsp;in 2007, scientists determined that cats'' short-term memory of certain things lasts 10 minutes. The scientists tested it by stopping cats after their forelegs, but not their hindlegs, had cleared an obstacle. They distracted the cat with food and then waited to see how long the cats would remember having stepped over the obstacle. The cats remembered for about 10 minutes and would&nbsp;<a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #04bfc3; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/08/21/cats-short-term-memory-lasts-about-10-minutes/" target="_blank">bring their hind legs up where they remembered an obstacle</a>, even if it had been removed.</span></p>

"We''ve found that the long-lasting memory for guiding hind legs over an obstacle requires stepping of the forelegs over the obstacle," researcher Keir Pearson of the University of Alberta in Canada said. "The main surprise was how short lasting the visual memory on its own was&mdash;just a few seconds when animals were stopped before their forelegs stepped over the obstacle."</span></p>

"Our data suggest that cats were attracted to ancient farming villages by small animals, such as rodents that were living on the grain that the farmers grew, ate and stored," says Fiona Marshall, study co-author and archaeology professor at Washington University in St. Louis. "Results of this study show that the village of Quanhucun was a source of food for the cats 5300 years ago, and the relationship between humans and cats was commensal, or advantageous for the cats. Even if these cats were not yet domesticated, our evidence confirms that they lived in close proximity to farmers, and that the relationship had mutual benefits."</span></span></p>

<p>According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, &ldquo;cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:</p>
<p>10) I&rsquo;m hurt &ndash; If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat&rsquo;s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn&rsquo;t typical. &ldquo;Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,&rdquo; advises Web MD.</p>
<p>9) I&rsquo;m just saying hi &ndash; Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.<img style="float: left;" src="http://www.clker.com/cliparts/f/2/c/4/1362609953990473477kitten%2011.jpg" alt="meowing" width="250" height="249" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;8) I want food &ndash; The &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry&rdquo; meow is likely one all cat parents know well. &ldquo;Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it&rsquo;s time for dinner,&rdquo; says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. &ldquo;My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;7) Pay attention to me &ndash; Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention &ndash; and they learn that meowing gets them just that. &ldquo;Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,&rdquo; explains Web MD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;6) Let me in - &ldquo;If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,&rdquo; says Harrell. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn&rsquo;t want to come in &ndash; she just doesn&rsquo;t like having it closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;5) I&rsquo;m in heat &ndash; A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. &ldquo;Another good reason for spaying!&rdquo; she adds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4) I&rsquo;m stressed &ndash; According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.</p>
<p>3) I&rsquo;m ticked off &ndash; &ldquo;Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,&rdquo; says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.</p>
<p>2) I don&rsquo;t want to be alone &ndash; According to The Ohio State University&rsquo;s College of Veterinary Medicine&rsquo;s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.</p>
<p>1) I&rsquo;m getting older &ndash; &ldquo;Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,&rdquo; says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.</p>
<p>Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings. Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.</p>', 22, '2015-05-30 23:28:48.000000')[0m

AND THEIR SHORT-TERM MEMORIES ARE PRETTY GOOD&mdash;UNDER THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES.</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: ''comic sans ms'', sans-serif;">Short-term memories typically fade away in about a minute, but in a study published in<em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">Current Biology</em>&nbsp;in 2007, scientists determined that cats'' short-term memory of certain things lasts 10 minutes. The scientists tested it by stopping cats after their forelegs, but not their hindlegs, had cleared an obstacle. They distracted the cat with food and then waited to see how long the cats would remember having stepped over the obstacle. The cats remembered for about 10 minutes and would&nbsp;<a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #04bfc3; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/08/21/cats-short-term-memory-lasts-about-10-minutes/" target="_blank">bring their hind legs up where they remembered an obstacle</a>, even if it had been removed.</span></p>

"We''ve found that the long-lasting memory for guiding hind legs over an obstacle requires stepping of the forelegs over the obstacle," researcher Keir Pearson of the University of Alberta in Canada said.

<p>According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, &ldquo;cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:</p>
<p>10) I&rsquo;m hurt &ndash; If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat&rsquo;s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn&rsquo;t typical. &ldquo;Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,&rdquo; advises Web MD.</p>
<p>9) I&rsquo;m just saying hi &ndash; Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.<img style="float: left;" src="http://www.clker.com/cliparts/f/2/c/4/1362609953990473477kitten%2011.jpg" alt="meowing" width="250" height="249" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;8) I want food &ndash; The &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry&rdquo; meow is likely one all cat parents know well. &ldquo;Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it&rsquo;s time for dinner,&rdquo; says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. &ldquo;My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;7) Pay attention to me &ndash; Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention &ndash; and they learn that meowing gets them just that. &ldquo;Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,&rdquo; explains Web MD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;6) Let me in - &ldquo;If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,&rdquo; says Harrell. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn&rsquo;t want to come in &ndash; she just doesn&rsquo;t like having it closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;5) I&rsquo;m in heat &ndash; A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. &ldquo;Another good reason for spaying!&rdquo; she adds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4) I&rsquo;m stressed &ndash; According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.</p>
<p>3) I&rsquo;m ticked off &ndash; &ldquo;Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,&rdquo; says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.</p>
<p>2) I don&rsquo;t want to be alone &ndash; According to The Ohio State University&rsquo;s College of Veterinary Medicine&rsquo;s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.</p>
<p>1) I&rsquo;m getting older &ndash; &ldquo;Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,&rdquo; says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.</p>
<p>Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings. Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.</p>', 22, '2015-05-30 23:28:48.000000')

<p>According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, &ldquo;cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:</p>
<p>10) I&rsquo;m hurt &ndash; If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat&rsquo;s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn&rsquo;t typical. &ldquo;Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,&rdquo; advises Web MD.</p>
<p>9) I&rsquo;m just saying hi &ndash; Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.<img style="float: left;" src="http://www.clker.com/cliparts/f/2/c/4/1362609953990473477kitten%2011.jpg" alt="meowing" width="250" height="249" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;8) I want food &ndash; The &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry&rdquo; meow is likely one all cat parents know well. &ldquo;Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it&rsquo;s time for dinner,&rdquo; says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. &ldquo;My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;7) Pay attention to me &ndash; Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention &ndash; and they learn that meowing gets them just that. &ldquo;Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,&rdquo; explains Web MD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;6) Let me in - &ldquo;If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,&rdquo; says Harrell. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn&rsquo;t want to come in &ndash; she just doesn&rsquo;t like having it closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;5) I&rsquo;m in heat &ndash; A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. &ldquo;Another good reason for spaying!&rdquo; she adds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4) I&rsquo;m stressed &ndash; According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.</p>
<p>3) I&rsquo;m ticked off &ndash; &ldquo;Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,&rdquo; says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.</p>
<p>2) I don&rsquo;t want to be alone &ndash; According to The Ohio State University&rsquo;s College of Veterinary Medicine&rsquo;s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.</p>
<p>1) I&rsquo;m getting older &ndash; &ldquo;Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,&rdquo; says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.</p>
<p>Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings. Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.</p>', 22, '2015-05-30 23:28:48.000000')[0m

AND THEIR SHORT-TERM MEMORIES ARE PRETTY GOOD&mdash;UNDER THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES.</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: ''comic sans ms'', sans-serif;">Short-term memories typically fade away in about a minute, but in a study published in<em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">Current Biology</em>&nbsp;in 2007, scientists determined that cats'' short-term memory of certain things lasts 10 minutes. The scientists tested it by stopping cats after their forelegs, but not their hindlegs, had cleared an obstacle. They distracted the cat with food and then waited to see how long the cats would remember having stepped over the obstacle. The cats remembered for about 10 minutes and would&nbsp;<a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #04bfc3; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/08/21/cats-short-term-memory-lasts-about-10-minutes/" target="_blank">bring their hind legs up where they remembered an obstacle</a>, even if it had been removed.</span></p>

"We''ve found that the long-lasting memory for guiding hind legs over an obstacle requires stepping of the forelegs over the obstacle," researcher Keir Pearson of the University of Alberta in Canada said. "The main surprise was how short lasting the visual memory on its own was&mdash;just a few seconds when animals were stopped before their forelegs stepped over the obstacle."</span></p>

"Our data suggest that cats were attracted to ancient farming villages by small animals, such as rodents that were living on the grain that the farmers grew, ate and stored," says Fiona Marshall, study co-author and archaeology professor at Washington University in St. Louis. "Results of this study show that the village of Quanhucun was a source of food for the cats 5300 years ago, and the relationship between humans and cats was commensal, or advantageous for the cats. Even if these cats were not yet domesticated, our evidence confirms that they lived in close proximity to farmers, and that the relationship had mutual benefits."</span></span></p>

<p>According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, &ldquo;cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:</p>
<p>10) I&rsquo;m hurt &ndash; If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat&rsquo;s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn&rsquo;t typical. &ldquo;Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,&rdquo; advises Web MD.</p>
<p>9) I&rsquo;m just saying hi &ndash; Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.<img style="float: left;" src="http://www.clker.com/cliparts/f/2/c/4/1362609953990473477kitten%2011.jpg" alt="meowing" width="250" height="249" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;8) I want food &ndash; The &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry&rdquo; meow is likely one all cat parents know well. &ldquo;Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it&rsquo;s time for dinner,&rdquo; says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. &ldquo;My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;7) Pay attention to me &ndash; Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention &ndash; and they learn that meowing gets them just that. &ldquo;Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,&rdquo; explains Web MD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;6) Let me in - &ldquo;If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,&rdquo; says Harrell. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn&rsquo;t want to come in &ndash; she just doesn&rsquo;t like having it closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;5) I&rsquo;m in heat &ndash; A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. &ldquo;Another good reason for spaying!&rdquo; she adds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4) I&rsquo;m stressed &ndash; According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.</p>
<p>3) I&rsquo;m ticked off &ndash; &ldquo;Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,&rdquo; says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.</p>
<p>2) I don&rsquo;t want to be alone &ndash; According to The Ohio State University&rsquo;s College of Veterinary Medicine&rsquo;s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.</p>
<p>1) I&rsquo;m getting older &ndash; &ldquo;Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,&rdquo; says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.</p>
<p>Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings. Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.</p>', 22, '2015-05-30 23:28:48.000000')

AND THEIR SHORT-TERM MEMORIES ARE PRETTY GOOD&mdash;UNDER THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES.</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: ''comic sans ms'', sans-serif;">Short-term memories typically fade away in about a minute, but in a study published in<em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">Current Biology</em>&nbsp;in 2007, scientists determined that cats'' short-term memory of certain things lasts 10 minutes. The scientists tested it by stopping cats after their forelegs, but not their hindlegs, had cleared an obstacle. They distracted the cat with food and then waited to see how long the cats would remember having stepped over the obstacle. The cats remembered for about 10 minutes and would&nbsp;<a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #04bfc3; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/08/21/cats-short-term-memory-lasts-about-10-minutes/" target="_blank">bring their hind legs up where they remembered an obstacle</a>, even if it had been removed.</span></p>

"We''ve found that the long-lasting memory for guiding hind legs over an obstacle requires stepping of the forelegs over the obstacle," researcher Keir Pearson of the University of Alberta in Canada said. "The main surprise was how short lasting the visual memory on its own was&mdash;just a few seconds when animals were stopped before their forelegs stepped over the obstacle."</span></p>

"Our data suggest that cats were attracted to ancient farming villages by small animals, such as rodents that were living on the grain that the farmers grew, ate and stored," says Fiona Marshall, study co-author and archaeology professor at Washington University in St. Louis. "Results of this study show that the village of Quanhucun was a source of food for the cats 5300 years ago, and the relationship between humans and cats was commensal, or advantageous for the cats. Even if these cats were not yet domesticated, our evidence confirms that they lived in close proximity to farmers, and that the relationship had mutual benefits."</span></span></p>

<p>According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, &ldquo;cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:</p>
<p>10) I&rsquo;m hurt &ndash; If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat&rsquo;s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn&rsquo;t typical. &ldquo;Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,&rdquo; advises Web MD.</p>
<p>9) I&rsquo;m just saying hi &ndash; Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.<img style="float: left;" src="http://www.clker.com/cliparts/f/2/c/4/1362609953990473477kitten%2011.jpg" alt="meowing" width="250" height="249" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;8) I want food &ndash; The &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry&rdquo; meow is likely one all cat parents know well. &ldquo;Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it&rsquo;s time for dinner,&rdquo; says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. &ldquo;My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;7) Pay attention to me &ndash; Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention &ndash; and they learn that meowing gets them just that. &ldquo;Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,&rdquo; explains Web MD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;6) Let me in - &ldquo;If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,&rdquo; says Harrell. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn&rsquo;t want to come in &ndash; she just doesn&rsquo;t like having it closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;5) I&rsquo;m in heat &ndash; A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. &ldquo;Another good reason for spaying!&rdquo; she adds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4) I&rsquo;m stressed &ndash; According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.</p>
<p>3) I&rsquo;m ticked off &ndash; &ldquo;Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,&rdquo; says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.</p>
<p>2) I don&rsquo;t want to be alone &ndash; According to The Ohio State University&rsquo;s College of Veterinary Medicine&rsquo;s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.</p>
<p>1) I&rsquo;m getting older &ndash; &ldquo;Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,&rdquo; says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.</p>
<p>Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings. Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.</p>', 22, '2015-05-30 23:28:48.000000')[0m

AND THEIR SHORT-TERM MEMORIES ARE PRETTY GOOD&mdash;UNDER THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES.</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: ''comic sans ms'', sans-serif;">Short-term memories typically fade away in about a minute, but in a study published in<em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">Current Biology</em>&nbsp;in 2007, scientists determined that cats'' short-term memory of certain things lasts 10 minutes. The scientists tested it by stopping cats after their forelegs, but not their hindlegs, had cleared an obstacle. They distracted the cat with food and then waited to see how long the cats would remember having stepped over the obstacle. The cats remembered for about 10 minutes and would&nbsp;<a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #04bfc3; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/08/21/cats-short-term-memory-lasts-about-10-minutes/" target="_blank">bring their hind legs up where they remembered an obstacle</a>, even if it had been removed.</span></p>

"We''ve found that the long-lasting memory for guiding hind legs over an obstacle requires stepping of the forelegs over the obstacle," researcher Keir Pearson of the University of Alberta in Canada said. "The main surprise was how short lasting the visual memory on its own was&mdash;just a few seconds when animals were stopped before their forelegs stepped over the obstacle."</span></p>

"Our data suggest that cats were attracted to ancient farming villages by small animals, such as rodents that were living on the grain that the farmers grew, ate and stored," says Fiona Marshall, study co-author and archaeology professor at Washington University in St. Louis. "Results of this study show that the village of Quanhucun was a source of food for the cats 5300 years ago, and the relationship between humans and cats was commensal, or advantageous for the cats. Even if these cats were not yet domesticated, our evidence confirms that they lived in close proximity to farmers, and that the relationship had mutual benefits."</span></span></p>

<p>According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, &ldquo;cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:</p>
<p>10) I&rsquo;m hurt &ndash; If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat&rsquo;s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn&rsquo;t typical. &ldquo;Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,&rdquo; advises Web MD.</p>
<p>9) I&rsquo;m just saying hi &ndash; Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.<img style="float: left;" src="http://www.clker.com/cliparts/f/2/c/4/1362609953990473477kitten%2011.jpg" alt="meowing" width="250" height="249" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;8) I want food &ndash; The &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry&rdquo; meow is likely one all cat parents know well. &ldquo;Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it&rsquo;s time for dinner,&rdquo; says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. &ldquo;My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;7) Pay attention to me &ndash; Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention &ndash; and they learn that meowing gets them just that. &ldquo;Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,&rdquo; explains Web MD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;6) Let me in - &ldquo;If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,&rdquo; says Harrell. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn&rsquo;t want to come in &ndash; she just doesn&rsquo;t like having it closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;5) I&rsquo;m in heat &ndash; A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. &ldquo;Another good reason for spaying!&rdquo; she adds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4) I&rsquo;m stressed &ndash; According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.</p>
<p>3) I&rsquo;m ticked off &ndash; &ldquo;Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,&rdquo; says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.</p>
<p>2) I don&rsquo;t want to be alone &ndash; According to The Ohio State University&rsquo;s College of Veterinary Medicine&rsquo;s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.</p>
<p>1) I&rsquo;m getting older &ndash; &ldquo;Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,&rdquo; says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.</p>
<p>Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings. Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.</p>', 22, '2015-05-30 23:28:48.000000')

AND THEIR SHORT-TERM MEMORIES ARE PRETTY GOOD&mdash;UNDER THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES.</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: ''comic sans ms'', sans-serif;">Short-term memories typically fade away in about a minute, but in a study published in<em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">Current Biology</em>&nbsp;in 2007, scientists determined that cats'' short-term memory of certain things lasts 10 minutes. The scientists tested it by stopping cats after their forelegs, but not their hindlegs, had cleared an obstacle. They distracted the cat with food and then waited to see how long the cats would remember having stepped over the obstacle. The cats remembered for about 10 minutes and would&nbsp;<a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #04bfc3; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/08/21/cats-short-term-memory-lasts-about-10-minutes/" target="_blank">bring their hind legs up where they remembered an obstacle</a>, even if it had been removed.</span></p>

"We''ve found that the long-lasting memory for guiding hind legs over an obstacle requires stepping of the forelegs over the obstacle," researcher Keir Pearson of the University of Alberta in Canada said. "The main surprise was how short lasting the visual memory on its own was&mdash;just a few seconds when animals were stopped before their forelegs stepped over the obstacle."</span></p>

"Our data suggest that cats were attracted to ancient farming villages by small animals, such as rodents that were living on the grain that the farmers grew, ate and stored," says Fiona Marshall, study co-author and archaeology professor at Washington University in St. Louis. "Results of this study show that the village of Quanhucun was a source of food for the cats 5300 years ago, and the relationship between humans and cats was commensal, or advantageous for the cats. Even if these cats were not yet domesticated, our evidence confirms that they lived in close proximity to farmers, and that the relationship had mutual benefits."</span></span></p>

With so many types of litter out there, which one is the best for you and your Kitty? Clumping or non-clumping? Scented? Silica or clay? Flushable? Wheat, walnuts, corn or maybe recycled newspaper? With so many choices out there, we&rsquo;re here to help with this quick guide!</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 21.3333339691162px; letter-spacing: -1px; line-height: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\">What Does Your Cat Like?</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0pt 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">Before we jump into the litterbox, there is one thing you must remember. It&rsquo;s all about what the cat prefers. Cats have their own personal preferences when it comes to litter. These can be the result of sensitive paws, habits created during kittenhood, or simply a whim. Why your cat prefers one kind of litter and not another may forever be a riddle shrouded in mystery. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter. What matters is that you provide your cat with the kind of litter he or she feels comfortable with. Otherwise, they may reject the litterbox altogether. Elimination problems are easier to prevent than to fix, so make sure you read through this guide with your cat&rsquo;s preference in mind.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"margin: 10pt 0px 0pt; padding: 0px 0px 4px; font-size: 21.5459976196289px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1em; color: #444444; letter-spacing: -1px; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;\"><span id=\"user_docs-internal-guid-1ba8c600-a106-df82-baec-2db081fa97af\" style=\"line-height: normal;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit; color: #000000; vertical-align: baseline;\">Cat Litter Considerations</strong></span></h2>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><strong style=\"color: #181818; line-height: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\">Clumping vs. non-clumping</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><a class=\"H-lightbox-open\" style=\"color: #cc3300;\" href=\"http://www.thecatsite.com/content/type/61/id/201083/width/500/height/700\"><img class=\"lightbox-enabled\" style=\"border: 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 167px; float: left; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; width: 250px;\" src=\"http://www.thecatsite.com/content/type/61/id/201083/width/250/height/700/flags/LL\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"201083\" data-type=\"61\" /></a></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">Perhaps the most notable characteristic of cat litter is whether it clumps in the presence of liquid or not.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">Clumping litter usually contains a substance called bentonite which absorbs the urine and creates a nice solid lump, leaving the rest of the litter around it dry and clean. When it&rsquo;s scooping time, you just take out the hardened urine clumps along with the feces.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">Non-clumping litter simply lets urine sift through, absorbing some of the odor through additives such as baking soda or charcoal. You can only scoop out feces, while the urine dries up in the rest of the litter. The only way to clean the urine from the box is by changing all of the litter, usually once a week. Some non-clumping litter is based on silica crystals. The silica crystals are very similar to those used in desiccants. They absorb the urine more quickly than grains of clay would, allowing the water to slowly evaporate while keeping the \"smelly stuff\" inside them.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">For the cats, clumping or non-clumping is a matter of personal preference. Owners often prefer clumping litter because it&rsquo;s easier to clean the box and there's no need to change all of the litter at once. Clumping litter is usually more expensive, yet you need less of it in the long run.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">Some owners find that clumping litter tends to &ldquo;stick&rdquo; to the cat. This may be of concern with long-haired cats and kittens, as they are more likely to get litter on their coat, ingesting it as they groom themselves. Which brings us to our next consideration&hellip;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0pt 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit; color: #181818; vertical-align: baseline;\">Safety Issues</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">Cats may ingest some cat litter, either by inhaling its dust as they dig around in the box, or by accidentally licking litter grains that got stuck in their fur or between their toes. Generally speaking, manufacturers are aware of this issue and cat litter is non-toxic to cats.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">In rare cases, kittens, or cats with a rare disorder called Pica, may attempt to eat the litter. If you think your cat may have swallowed a considerable amount of litter, do contact your vet.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">If dust is a concern for you, you can find formulas that are intended to be dust-free or low in dust. What the dust is actually made of can also be a consideration. Basically, it can be food-based dust from corn or wheat, or mineral-based from clay or silica. Some cats may be allergic to either kind.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0pt 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit; color: #181818; vertical-align: baseline;\">Odor Control</strong></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal; color: #181818;\">Probably one of the most important factors for cat owners! You should opt for cat litter that absorbs odor rather than masking it. Scented litters usually do the latter, surrounding the litterbox with some kind of floral scent.

It&rsquo;s all about what the cat prefers. Cats have their own personal preferences when it comes to litter. These can be the result of sensitive paws, habits created during kittenhood, or simply a whim. Why your cat prefers one kind of litter and not another may forever be a riddle shrouded in mystery. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter. What matters is that you provide your cat with the kind of litter he or she feels comfortable with. Otherwise, they may reject the litterbox altogether. Elimination problems are easier to prevent than to fix, so make sure you read through this guide with your cat&rsquo;s preference in mind.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"margin: 10pt 0px 0pt; padding: 0px 0px 4px; font-size: 21.5459976196289px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1em; color: #444444; letter-spacing: -1px; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;\"><span id=\"user_docs-internal-guid-1ba8c600-a106-df82-baec-2db081fa97af\" style=\"line-height: normal;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit; color: #000000; vertical-align: baseline;\">Cat Litter Considerations</strong></span></h2>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><strong style=\"color: #181818; line-height: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\">Clumping vs. non-clumping</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><a class=\"H-lightbox-open\" style=\"color: #cc3300;\" href=\"http://www.thecatsite.com/content/type/61/id/201083/width/500/height/700\"><img class=\"lightbox-enabled\" style=\"border: 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 167px; float: left; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; width: 250px;\" src=\"http://www.thecatsite.com/content/type/61/id/201083/width/250/height/700/flags/LL\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"201083\" data-type=\"61\" /></a></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">Perhaps the most notable characteristic of cat litter is whether it clumps in the presence of liquid or not.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">Clumping litter usually contains a substance called bentonite which absorbs the urine and creates a nice solid lump, leaving the rest of the litter around it dry and clean. When it&rsquo;s scooping time, you just take out the hardened urine clumps along with the feces.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">Non-clumping litter simply lets urine sift through, absorbing some of the odor through additives such as baking soda or charcoal. You can only scoop out feces, while the urine dries up in the rest of the litter. The only way to clean the urine from the box is by changing all of the litter, usually once a week. Some non-clumping litter is based on silica crystals. The silica crystals are very similar to those used in desiccants. They absorb the urine more quickly than grains of clay would, allowing the water to slowly evaporate while keeping the \"smelly stuff\" inside them.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">For the cats, clumping or non-clumping is a matter of personal preference. Owners often prefer clumping litter because it&rsquo;s easier to clean the box and there's no need to change all of the litter at once. Clumping litter is usually more expensive, yet you need less of it in the long run.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">Some owners find that clumping litter tends to &ldquo;stick&rdquo; to the cat. This may be of concern with long-haired cats and kittens, as they are more likely to get litter on their coat, ingesting it as they groom themselves. Which brings us to our next consideration&hellip;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0pt 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit; color: #181818; vertical-align: baseline;\">Safety Issues</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">Cats may ingest some cat litter, either by inhaling its dust as they dig around in the box, or by accidentally licking litter grains that got stuck in their fur or between their toes. Generally speaking, manufacturers are aware of this issue and cat litter is non-toxic to cats.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">In rare cases, kittens, or cats with a rare disorder called Pica, may attempt to eat the litter. If you think your cat may have swallowed a considerable amount of litter, do contact your vet.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">If dust is a concern for you, you can find formulas that are intended to be dust-free or low in dust. What the dust is actually made of can also be a consideration. Basically, it can be food-based dust from corn or wheat, or mineral-based from clay or silica. Some cats may be allergic to either kind.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0pt 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit; color: #181818; vertical-align: baseline;\">Odor Control</strong></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal; color: #181818;\">Probably one of the most important factors for cat owners! You should opt for cat litter that absorbs odor rather than masking it. Scented litters usually do the latter, surrounding the litterbox with some kind of floral scent. This is fine as long as you realize it does not give you license to leave the litterbox dirty for a longer period of time!</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0pt 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"color: #181818; vertical-align: baseline;\">Cats have a sensitive sense of smell.

With so many types of litter out there, which one is the best for you and your Kitty? Clumping or non-clumping? Scented? Silica or clay? Flushable? Wheat, walnuts, corn or maybe recycled newspaper? With so many choices out there, we&rsquo;re here to help with this quick guide!</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">&nbsp;<strong style=\"font-size: 21.3333339691162px; letter-spacing: -1px; line-height: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\">What Does Your Cat Like?</strong></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Before we jump into the litterbox, there is one thing you must remember. It&rsquo;s all about what the cat prefers. Cats have their own personal preferences when it comes to litter. These can be the result of sensitive paws, habits created during kittenhood, or simply a whim. Why your cat prefers one kind of litter and not another may forever be a riddle shrouded in mystery. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter. What matters is that you provide your cat with the kind of litter he or she feels comfortable with. Otherwise, they may reject the litterbox altogether. Elimination problems are easier to prevent than to fix, so make sure you read through this guide with your cat&rsquo;s preference in mind.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"margin: 10pt 0px 0pt; padding: 0px 0px 4px; font-size: 21.5459976196289px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1em; color: #444444; letter-spacing: -1px; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;\"><span id=\"user_docs-internal-guid-1ba8c600-a106-df82-baec-2db081fa97af\" style=\"line-height: normal; font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit; color: #000000; vertical-align: baseline;\">Cat Litter Considerations</strong></span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"><strong style=\"color: #181818; line-height: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\">Clumping vs. non-clumping</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"><a class=\"H-lightbox-open\" style=\"color: #cc3300;\" href=\"http://www.thecatsite.com/content/type/61/id/201083/width/500/height/700\"><img class=\"lightbox-enabled\" style=\"border: 0px; height: 167px; float: left; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; width: 250px;\" src=\"http://www.thecatsite.com/content/type/61/id/201083/width/250/height/700/flags/LL\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"201083\" data-type=\"61\" /></a></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Perhaps the most notable characteristic of cat litter is whether it clumps in the presence of liquid or not.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Clumping litter usually contains a substance called bentonite which absorbs the urine and creates a nice solid lump, leaving the rest of the litter around it dry and clean. When it&rsquo;s scooping time, you just take out the hardened urine clumps along with the feces.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Non-clumping litter simply lets urine sift through, absorbing some of the odor through additives such as baking soda or charcoal. You can only scoop out feces, while the urine dries up in the rest of the litter. The only way to clean the urine from the box is by changing all of the litter, usually once a week. Some non-clumping litter is based on silica crystals. The silica crystals are very similar to those used in desiccants. They absorb the urine more quickly than grains of clay would, allowing the water to slowly evaporate while keeping the \"smelly stuff\" inside them.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">&nbsp;For the cats, clumping or non-clumping is a matter of personal preference. Owners often prefer clumping litter because it&rsquo;s easier to clean the box and there's no need to change all of the litter at once. Clumping litter is usually more expensive, yet you need less of it in the long run.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Some owners find that clumping litter tends to &ldquo;stick&rdquo; to the cat. This may be of concern with long-haired cats and kittens, as they are more likely to get litter on their coat, ingesting it as they groom themselves. Which brings us to our next consideration&hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit; color: #181818; vertical-align: baseline;\">Safety Issues</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Cats may ingest some cat litter, either by inhaling its dust as they dig around in the box, or by accidentally licking litter grains that got stuck in their fur or between their toes. Generally speaking, manufacturers are aware of this issue and cat litter is non-toxic to cats.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">In rare cases, kittens, or cats with a rare disorder called Pica, may attempt to eat the litter. If you think your cat may have swallowed a considerable amount of litter, do contact your vet.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">If dust is a concern for you, you can find formulas that are intended to be dust-free or low in dust. What the dust is actually made of can also be a consideration. Basically, it can be food-based dust from corn or wheat, or mineral-based from clay or silica. Some cats may be allergic to either kind.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit; color: #181818; vertical-align: baseline;\">Odor Control</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Probably one of the most important factors for cat owners! You should opt for cat litter that absorbs odor rather than masking it. Scented litters usually do the latter, surrounding the litterbox with some kind of floral scent. This is fine as long as you realize it does not give you license to leave the litterbox dirty for a longer period of time!</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Cats have a sensitive sense of smell. They will notice if the box is dirty, even if all you can smell is the air freshener in the litter. Some cats may even be bothered by a strong floral scent. As a rule, it&rsquo;s usually best to stick to unscented good-quality litter and make sure the box is cleaned as often as possible.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;\">Environmental considerations</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">The accumulated waste produced by used kitty litter can have a significant environmental impact. Disposing of litter by either flushing it down the toilet, or dumping it in bags inside trash bins, is not very earth-friendly, yet with many types of litter those are your only options. If you have access to a garden, you can opt for a &ldquo;greener&rdquo; solution by switching to plant-based litter, to be disposed of in the compost pile. This solution can only work with organic matter, i.e. litter made of wheat, corn or some other plant material.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit; color: #181818; vertical-align: baseline;\">Specific Sensitivities and Allergies</strong></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Some cats have allergies to specific ingredients in the litter. Both natural minerals and plants, as well as lab-manufactured additives, can trigger allergies in cats. If your cat develops an allergy, you should consider the litter as a possible source as you work with your vet to eliminate potential allergens.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Even without triggering an allergic reaction per se, some kinds of litter may simply be uncomfortable for Kitty&rsquo;s paws. Declawed cats are prone to having litterbox problems due to associating the litter with pain in their paws. Sometimes switching to softer litter helps.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit; color: #181818; vertical-align: baseline;\">Price and packaging</strong></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Last but not necessarily least, you should consider cost and ease of use. Comparing the prices of litter is not always easy. It&rsquo;s not only the amount of litter, whether by weight or volume, that needs to be taken into account, but how long you can use it.

It&rsquo;s all about what the cat prefers. Cats have their own personal preferences when it comes to litter. These can be the result of sensitive paws, habits created during kittenhood, or simply a whim. Why your cat prefers one kind of litter and not another may forever be a riddle shrouded in mystery. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter. What matters is that you provide your cat with the kind of litter he or she feels comfortable with. Otherwise, they may reject the litterbox altogether.

When it&rsquo;s scooping time, you just take out the hardened urine clumps along with the feces.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Non-clumping litter simply lets urine sift through, absorbing some of the odor through additives such as baking soda or charcoal. You can only scoop out feces, while the urine dries up in the rest of the litter. The only way to clean the urine from the box is by changing all of the litter, usually once a week. Some non-clumping litter is based on silica crystals. The silica crystals are very similar to those used in desiccants. They absorb the urine more quickly than grains of clay would, allowing the water to slowly evaporate while keeping the \"smelly stuff\" inside them.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">&nbsp;For the cats, clumping or non-clumping is a matter of personal preference. Owners often prefer clumping litter because it&rsquo;s easier to clean the box and there's no need to change all of the litter at once. Clumping litter is usually more expensive, yet you need less of it in the long run.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Some owners find that clumping litter tends to &ldquo;stick&rdquo; to the cat. This may be of concern with long-haired cats and kittens, as they are more likely to get litter on their coat, ingesting it as they groom themselves. Which brings us to our next consideration&hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit; color: #181818; vertical-align: baseline;\">Safety Issues</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Cats may ingest some cat litter, either by inhaling its dust as they dig around in the box, or by accidentally licking litter grains that got stuck in their fur or between their toes. Generally speaking, manufacturers are aware of this issue and cat litter is non-toxic to cats.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">In rare cases, kittens, or cats with a rare disorder called Pica, may attempt to eat the litter. If you think your cat may have swallowed a considerable amount of litter, do contact your vet.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">If dust is a concern for you, you can find formulas that are intended to be dust-free or low in dust. What the dust is actually made of can also be a consideration. Basically, it can be food-based dust from corn or wheat, or mineral-based from clay or silica. Some cats may be allergic to either kind.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit; color: #181818; vertical-align: baseline;\">Odor Control</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Probably one of the most important factors for cat owners! You should opt for cat litter that absorbs odor rather than masking it. Scented litters usually do the latter, surrounding the litterbox with some kind of floral scent. This is fine as long as you realize it does not give you license to leave the litterbox dirty for a longer period of time!</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Cats have a sensitive sense of smell. They will notice if the box is dirty, even if all you can smell is the air freshener in the litter. Some cats may even be bothered by a strong floral scent. As a rule, it&rsquo;s usually best to stick to unscented good-quality litter and make sure the box is cleaned as often as possible.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;\">Environmental considerations</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">The accumulated waste produced by used kitty litter can have a significant environmental impact. Disposing of litter by either flushing it down the toilet, or dumping it in bags inside trash bins, is not very earth-friendly, yet with many types of litter those are your only options. If you have access to a garden, you can opt for a &ldquo;greener&rdquo; solution by switching to plant-based litter, to be disposed of in the compost pile. This solution can only work with organic matter, i.e. litter made of wheat, corn or some other plant material.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit; color: #181818; vertical-align: baseline;\">Specific Sensitivities and Allergies</strong></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Some cats have allergies to specific ingredients in the litter. Both natural minerals and plants, as well as lab-manufactured additives, can trigger allergies in cats. If your cat develops an allergy, you should consider the litter as a possible source as you work with your vet to eliminate potential allergens.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Even without triggering an allergic reaction per se, some kinds of litter may simply be uncomfortable for Kitty&rsquo;s paws. Declawed cats are prone to having litterbox problems due to associating the litter with pain in their paws. Sometimes switching to softer litter helps.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit; color: #181818; vertical-align: baseline;\">Price and packaging</strong></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Last but not necessarily least, you should consider cost and ease of use. Comparing the prices of litter is not always easy. It&rsquo;s not only the amount of litter, whether by weight or volume, that needs to be taken into account, but how long you can use it. The main consideration here is if and when you need to completely change all of the litter in the box.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Packaging can also affect your choice of litter. Huge sacks or boxes of clay or silica-based litter can be too heavy for some people to carry into their homes.

Elimination problems are easier to prevent than to fix, so make sure you read through this guide with your cat&rsquo;s preference in mind.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"margin: 10pt 0px 0pt; padding: 0px 0px 4px; font-size: 21.5459976196289px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1em; color: #444444; letter-spacing: -1px; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;\"><span id=\"user_docs-internal-guid-1ba8c600-a106-df82-baec-2db081fa97af\" style=\"line-height: normal; font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit; color: #000000; vertical-align: baseline;\">Cat Litter Considerations</strong></span></h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"><strong style=\"color: #181818; line-height: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\">Clumping vs. non-clumping</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"><a class=\"H-lightbox-open\" style=\"color: #cc3300;\" href=\"http://www.thecatsite.com/content/type/61/id/201083/width/500/height/700\"><img class=\"lightbox-enabled\" style=\"border: 0px; height: 167px; float: left; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; width: 250px;\" src=\"http://www.thecatsite.com/content/type/61/id/201083/width/250/height/700/flags/LL\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"201083\" data-type=\"61\" /></a></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Perhaps the most notable characteristic of cat litter is whether it clumps in the presence of liquid or not.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Clumping litter usually contains a substance called bentonite which absorbs the urine and creates a nice solid lump, leaving the rest of the litter around it dry and clean. When it&rsquo;s scooping time, you just take out the hardened urine clumps along with the feces.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Non-clumping litter simply lets urine sift through, absorbing some of the odor through additives such as baking soda or charcoal. You can only scoop out feces, while the urine dries up in the rest of the litter. The only way to clean the urine from the box is by changing all of the litter, usually once a week. Some non-clumping litter is based on silica crystals. The silica crystals are very similar to those used in desiccants. They absorb the urine more quickly than grains of clay would, allowing the water to slowly evaporate while keeping the \"smelly stuff\" inside them.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">&nbsp;For the cats, clumping or non-clumping is a matter of personal preference. Owners often prefer clumping litter because it&rsquo;s easier to clean the box and there's no need to change all of the litter at once. Clumping litter is usually more expensive, yet you need less of it in the long run.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Some owners find that clumping litter tends to &ldquo;stick&rdquo; to the cat. This may be of concern with long-haired cats and kittens, as they are more likely to get litter on their coat, ingesting it as they groom themselves. Which brings us to our next consideration&hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit; color: #181818; vertical-align: baseline;\">Safety Issues</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Cats may ingest some cat litter, either by inhaling its dust as they dig around in the box, or by accidentally licking litter grains that got stuck in their fur or between their toes. Generally speaking, manufacturers are aware of this issue and cat litter is non-toxic to cats.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">In rare cases, kittens, or cats with a rare disorder called Pica, may attempt to eat the litter. If you think your cat may have swallowed a considerable amount of litter, do contact your vet.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">If dust is a concern for you, you can find formulas that are intended to be dust-free or low in dust. What the dust is actually made of can also be a consideration. Basically, it can be food-based dust from corn or wheat, or mineral-based from clay or silica. Some cats may be allergic to either kind.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit; color: #181818; vertical-align: baseline;\">Odor Control</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Probably one of the most important factors for cat owners! You should opt for cat litter that absorbs odor rather than masking it. Scented litters usually do the latter, surrounding the litterbox with some kind of floral scent. This is fine as long as you realize it does not give you license to leave the litterbox dirty for a longer period of time!</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Cats have a sensitive sense of smell. They will notice if the box is dirty, even if all you can smell is the air freshener in the litter. Some cats may even be bothered by a strong floral scent. As a rule, it&rsquo;s usually best to stick to unscented good-quality litter and make sure the box is cleaned as often as possible.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;\">Environmental considerations</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">The accumulated waste produced by used kitty litter can have a significant environmental impact. Disposing of litter by either flushing it down the toilet, or dumping it in bags inside trash bins, is not very earth-friendly, yet with many types of litter those are your only options. If you have access to a garden, you can opt for a &ldquo;greener&rdquo; solution by switching to plant-based litter, to be disposed of in the compost pile. This solution can only work with organic matter, i.e. litter made of wheat, corn or some other plant material.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit; color: #181818; vertical-align: baseline;\">Specific Sensitivities and Allergies</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Some cats have allergies to specific ingredients in the litter. Both natural minerals and plants, as well as lab-manufactured additives, can trigger allergies in cats. If your cat develops an allergy, you should consider the litter as a possible source as you work with your vet to eliminate potential allergens.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Even without triggering an allergic reaction per se, some kinds of litter may simply be uncomfortable for Kitty&rsquo;s paws. Declawed cats are prone to having litterbox problems due to associating the litter with pain in their paws. Sometimes switching to softer litter helps.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit; color: #181818; vertical-align: baseline;\">Price and packaging</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Last but not necessarily least, you should consider cost and ease of use. Comparing the prices of litter is not always easy. It&rsquo;s not only the amount of litter, whether by weight or volume, that needs to be taken into account, but how long you can use it. The main consideration here is if and when you need to completely change all of the litter in the box.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Packaging can also affect your choice of litter. Huge sacks or boxes of clay or silica-based litter can be too heavy for some people to carry into their homes. This is especially true of non-clumping litter, which is often available in huge containers, due to the need to change all of the litter once a week.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"margin: 0pt 0px; padding: 0px 0px 4px; font-size: 21.5459976196289px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1em; color: #444444; letter-spacing: -1px; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal; color: #33cccc; font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit; color: #181818; vertical-align: baseline;\">So which do I choose?</strong></span></h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Judging by what our members use, clumping litter seems to be a popular choice.

This is especially true of non-clumping litter, which is often available in huge containers, due to the need to change all of the litter once a week.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"margin: 0pt 0px; padding: 0px 0px 4px; font-size: 21.5459976196289px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1em; color: #444444; letter-spacing: -1px; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal; color: #33cccc; font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit; color: #181818; vertical-align: baseline;\">So which do I choose?</strong></span></h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #464646; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Judging by what our members use, clumping litter seems to be a popular choice. If clay-based litters don&rsquo;t appeal to you, then plant-based litters are also commonly used. Check out our&nbsp;<a style=\"text-decoration: none; color: #22229c;\" href=\"http://www.thecatsite.com/products/category/litter\">Cat Litter Reviews section</a>&nbsp;to see which brands are more popular and why.
