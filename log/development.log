Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:\r\n\r\n10) I’m hurt – If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat’s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn’t typical. “Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,” advises Web MD.\r\n\r\n9) I’m just saying hi – Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.\r\n\r\n8) I want food – The “I’m hungry” meow is likely one all cat parents know well. “Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it’s time for dinner,” says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. “My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.”\r\n\r\n7) Pay attention to me – Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention – and they learn that meowing gets them just that. “Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,” explains Web MD.\r\n\r\n6) Let me in - “If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,” says Harrell. “I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn’t want to come in – she just doesn’t like having it closed.”\r\n\r\n5) I’m in heat – A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. “Another good reason for spaying!” she adds.\r\n\r\n4) I’m stressed – According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.\r\n\r\n3) I’m ticked off – “Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,” says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.\r\n\r\n2) I don’t want to be alone – According to The Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine’s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.\r\n\r\n1) I’m getting older – “Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,” says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.\r\n\r\nOf course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings.  Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better."}

According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, “cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.”

So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:

10) I’m hurt – If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat’s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn’t typical. “Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,” advises Web MD.

9) I’m just saying hi – Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.

8) I want food – The “I’m hungry” meow is likely one all cat parents know well. “Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it’s time for dinner,” says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. “My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.”

7) Pay attention to me – Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention – and they learn that meowing gets them just that. “Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,” explains Web MD.

6) Let me in - “If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,” says Harrell. “I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn’t want to come in – she just doesn’t like having it closed.”

5) I’m in heat – A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. “Another good reason for spaying!” she adds.

4) I’m stressed – According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.

3) I’m ticked off – “Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,” says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.

2) I don’t want to be alone – According to The Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine’s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.

1) I’m getting older – “Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,” says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.

Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings.  Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.', 22, '2015-05-26 03:35:24.822927')[0m

According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, “cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.”

So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:

10) I’m hurt – If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat’s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn’t typical. “Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,” advises Web MD.

9) I’m just saying hi – Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.

8) I want food – The “I’m hungry” meow is likely one all cat parents know well. “Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it’s time for dinner,” says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. “My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.”

7) Pay attention to me – Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention – and they learn that meowing gets them just that. “Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,” explains Web MD.

6) Let me in - “If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,” says Harrell. “I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn’t want to come in – she just doesn’t like having it closed.”

5) I’m in heat – A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. “Another good reason for spaying!” she adds.

4) I’m stressed – According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.

3) I’m ticked off – “Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,” says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.

2) I don’t want to be alone – According to The Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine’s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.

1) I’m getting older – “Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,” says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.

Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings.  Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.', 22, '2015-05-26 03:35:24.822927')[0m

According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, “cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.”

So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:

10) I’m hurt – If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat’s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn’t typical. “Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,” advises Web MD.

9) I’m just saying hi – Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.

8) I want food – The “I’m hungry” meow is likely one all cat parents know well. “Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it’s time for dinner,” says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. “My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.”

7) Pay attention to me – Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention – and they learn that meowing gets them just that. “Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,” explains Web MD.

6) Let me in - “If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,” says Harrell. “I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn’t want to come in – she just doesn’t like having it closed.”

5) I’m in heat – A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. “Another good reason for spaying!” she adds.

4) I’m stressed – According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.

3) I’m ticked off – “Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,” says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.

2) I don’t want to be alone – According to The Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine’s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.

1) I’m getting older – “Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,” says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.

Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings.  Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.', 22, '2015-05-26 03:35:24.822927')[0m

According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, “cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.”

So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:

10) I’m hurt – If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat’s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn’t typical. “Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,” advises Web MD.

9) I’m just saying hi – Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.

8) I want food – The “I’m hungry” meow is likely one all cat parents know well. “Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it’s time for dinner,” says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. “My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.”

7) Pay attention to me – Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention – and they learn that meowing gets them just that. “Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,” explains Web MD.

6) Let me in - “If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,” says Harrell. “I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn’t want to come in – she just doesn’t like having it closed.”

5) I’m in heat – A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. “Another good reason for spaying!” she adds.

4) I’m stressed – According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.

3) I’m ticked off – “Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,” says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.

2) I don’t want to be alone – According to The Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine’s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.

1) I’m getting older – “Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,” says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.

Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings.  Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.', 22, '2015-05-26 03:35:24.822927')[0m

According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, “cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.”

So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:

10) I’m hurt – If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat’s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn’t typical. “Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,” advises Web MD.

9) I’m just saying hi – Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.

8) I want food – The “I’m hungry” meow is likely one all cat parents know well. “Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it’s time for dinner,” says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. “My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.”

7) Pay attention to me – Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention – and they learn that meowing gets them just that. “Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,” explains Web MD.

6) Let me in - “If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,” says Harrell. “I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn’t want to come in – she just doesn’t like having it closed.”

5) I’m in heat – A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. “Another good reason for spaying!” she adds.

4) I’m stressed – According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.

3) I’m ticked off – “Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,” says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.

2) I don’t want to be alone – According to The Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine’s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.

1) I’m getting older – “Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,” says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.

Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings.  Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.', 22, '2015-05-26 03:35:24.822927')[0m

According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, “cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.”

So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:

10) I’m hurt – If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat’s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn’t typical. “Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,” advises Web MD.

9) I’m just saying hi – Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.

8) I want food – The “I’m hungry” meow is likely one all cat parents know well. “Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it’s time for dinner,” says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. “My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.”

7) Pay attention to me – Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention – and they learn that meowing gets them just that. “Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,” explains Web MD.

6) Let me in - “If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,” says Harrell. “I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn’t want to come in – she just doesn’t like having it closed.”

5) I’m in heat – A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. “Another good reason for spaying!” she adds.

4) I’m stressed – According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.

3) I’m ticked off – “Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,” says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.

2) I don’t want to be alone – According to The Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine’s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.

1) I’m getting older – “Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,” says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.

Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings.  Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.', 22, '2015-05-26 03:35:24.822927')[0m

According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, “cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.”

So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:

10) I’m hurt – If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat’s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn’t typical. “Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,” advises Web MD.

9) I’m just saying hi – Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.

8) I want food – The “I’m hungry” meow is likely one all cat parents know well. “Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it’s time for dinner,” says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. “My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.”

7) Pay attention to me – Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention – and they learn that meowing gets them just that. “Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,” explains Web MD.

6) Let me in - “If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,” says Harrell. “I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn’t want to come in – she just doesn’t like having it closed.”

5) I’m in heat – A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. “Another good reason for spaying!” she adds.

4) I’m stressed – According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.

3) I’m ticked off – “Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,” says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.

2) I don’t want to be alone – According to The Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine’s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.

1) I’m getting older – “Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,” says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.

Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings.  Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.', 22, '2015-05-26 03:35:24.822927')[0m

7) Pay attention to me – Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention – and they learn that meowing gets them just that. “Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,” explains Web MD.

6) Let me in - “If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,” says Harrell. “I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn’t want to come in – she just doesn’t like having it closed.”

5) I’m in heat – A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. “Another good reason for spaying!” she adds.

4) I’m stressed – According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.

3) I’m ticked off – “Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,” says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.

2) I don’t want to be alone – According to The Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine’s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.

1) I’m getting older – “Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,” says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.

Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings.  Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.', 22, '2015-05-26 03:35:24.822927')[0m

Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:</p>\r\n<p>10) I&rsquo;m hurt &ndash; If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat&rsquo;s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn&rsquo;t typical. &ldquo;Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,&rdquo; advises Web MD.</p>\r\n<p>9) I&rsquo;m just saying hi &ndash; Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"http://www.folksdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cute-cats-and-kittens-meowing-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"199\" />&nbsp;8) I want food &ndash; The &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry&rdquo; meow is likely one all cat parents know well. &ldquo;Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it&rsquo;s time for dinner,&rdquo; says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. &ldquo;My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;7) Pay attention to me &ndash; Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention &ndash; and they learn that meowing gets them just that. &ldquo;Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,&rdquo; explains Web MD.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;6) Let me in - &ldquo;If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,&rdquo; says Harrell. &ldquo;I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn&rsquo;t want to come in &ndash; she just doesn&rsquo;t like having it closed.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;5) I&rsquo;m in heat &ndash; A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. &ldquo;Another good reason for spaying!&rdquo; she adds.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;4) I&rsquo;m stressed &ndash; According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;3) I&rsquo;m ticked off &ndash; &ldquo;Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,&rdquo; says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.</p>\r\n<p>2) I don&rsquo;t want to be alone &ndash; According to The Ohio State University&rsquo;s College of Veterinary Medicine&rsquo;s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.</p>\r\n<p>1) I&rsquo;m getting older &ndash; &ldquo;Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,&rdquo; says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings. Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.</p>", "id"=>"13"}

Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:</p>\r\n<p>10) I&rsquo;m hurt &ndash; If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat&rsquo;s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn&rsquo;t typical. &ldquo;Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,&rdquo; advises Web MD.</p>\r\n<p>9) I&rsquo;m just saying hi &ndash; Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.</p>\r\n<p>8) I want food &ndash; The &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry&rdquo; meow is likely one all cat parents know well. &ldquo;Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it&rsquo;s time for dinner,&rdquo; says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. &ldquo;My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>7) Pay attention to me &ndash; Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention &ndash; and they learn that meowing gets them just that. &ldquo;Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,&rdquo; explains Web MD.</p>\r\n<p>6) Let me in - &ldquo;If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,&rdquo; says Harrell. &ldquo;I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn&rsquo;t want to come in &ndash; she just doesn&rsquo;t like having it closed.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>5) I&rsquo;m in heat &ndash; A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. &ldquo;Another good reason for spaying!&rdquo; she adds.</p>\r\n<p>4) I&rsquo;m stressed &ndash; According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.</p>\r\n<p>3) I&rsquo;m ticked off &ndash; &ldquo;Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,&rdquo; says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.</p>\r\n<p>2) I don&rsquo;t want to be alone &ndash; According to The Ohio State University&rsquo;s College of Veterinary Medicine&rsquo;s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.</p>\r\n<p>1) I&rsquo;m getting older &ndash; &ldquo;Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,&rdquo; says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings. Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.</p>", "id"=>"13"}

Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:</p>\r\n<p>10) I&rsquo;m hurt &ndash; If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat&rsquo;s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn&rsquo;t typical. &ldquo;Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,&rdquo; advises Web MD.</p>\r\n<p>9) I&rsquo;m just saying hi &ndash; Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.</p>\r\n<p>8) I want food &ndash; The &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry&rdquo; meow is likely one all cat parents know well. &ldquo;Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it&rsquo;s time for dinner,&rdquo; says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. &ldquo;My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>7) Pay attention to me &ndash; Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention &ndash; and they learn that meowing gets them just that. &ldquo;Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,&rdquo; explains Web MD.</p>\r\n<p>6) Let me in - &ldquo;If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,&rdquo; says Harrell. &ldquo;I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn&rsquo;t want to come in &ndash; she just doesn&rsquo;t like having it closed.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>5) I&rsquo;m in heat &ndash; A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. &ldquo;Another good reason for spaying!&rdquo; she adds.</p>\r\n<p>4) I&rsquo;m stressed &ndash; According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.</p>\r\n<p>3) I&rsquo;m ticked off &ndash; &ldquo;Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,&rdquo; says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.</p>\r\n<p>2) I don&rsquo;t want to be alone &ndash; According to The Ohio State University&rsquo;s College of Veterinary Medicine&rsquo;s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.</p>\r\n<p>1) I&rsquo;m getting older &ndash; &ldquo;Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,&rdquo; says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings. Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.</p>", "id"=>"13"}

According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, “cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.”

So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:

10) I’m hurt – If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat’s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn’t typical. “Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,” advises Web MD.

9) I’m just saying hi – Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.

8) I want food – The “I’m hungry” meow is likely one all cat parents know well. “Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it’s time for dinner,” says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. “My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.”

7) Pay attention to me – Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention – and they learn that meowing gets them just that. “Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,” explains Web MD.

6) Let me in - “If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,” says Harrell. “I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn’t want to come in – she just doesn’t like having it closed.”

5) I’m in heat – A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. “Another good reason for spaying!” she adds.

4) I’m stressed – According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.

3) I’m ticked off – “Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,” says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.

2) I don’t want to be alone – According to The Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine’s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.

1) I’m getting older – “Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,” says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.

Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings.  Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.', 22, '2015-05-26 03:35:24.822927')[0m

According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, “cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.”

So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:

10) I’m hurt – If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat’s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn’t typical. “Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,” advises Web MD.

9) I’m just saying hi – Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.

8) I want food – The “I’m hungry” meow is likely one all cat parents know well. “Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it’s time for dinner,” says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. “My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.”

7) Pay attention to me – Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention – and they learn that meowing gets them just that. “Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,” explains Web MD.

6) Let me in - “If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,” says Harrell. “I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn’t want to come in – she just doesn’t like having it closed.”

5) I’m in heat – A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. “Another good reason for spaying!” she adds.

4) I’m stressed – According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.

3) I’m ticked off – “Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,” says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.

2) I don’t want to be alone – According to The Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine’s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.

1) I’m getting older – “Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,” says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.

Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings.  Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.', 22, '2015-05-26 03:35:24.822927')[0m

According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, “cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.”

So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:

10) I’m hurt – If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat’s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn’t typical. “Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,” advises Web MD.

9) I’m just saying hi – Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.

8) I want food – The “I’m hungry” meow is likely one all cat parents know well. “Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it’s time for dinner,” says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. “My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.”

7) Pay attention to me – Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention – and they learn that meowing gets them just that. “Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,” explains Web MD.

6) Let me in - “If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,” says Harrell. “I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn’t want to come in – she just doesn’t like having it closed.”

5) I’m in heat – A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. “Another good reason for spaying!” she adds.

4) I’m stressed – According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.

3) I’m ticked off – “Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,” says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.

2) I don’t want to be alone – According to The Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine’s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.

1) I’m getting older – “Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,” says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.

Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings.  Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.', 22, '2015-05-26 03:35:24.822927')[0m

<p>According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, &ldquo;cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:</p>
<p>10) I&rsquo;m hurt &ndash; If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat&rsquo;s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn&rsquo;t typical. &ldquo;Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,&rdquo; advises Web MD.</p>
<p>9) I&rsquo;m just saying hi &ndash; Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.<img style="float: left;" src="http://www.clker.com/cliparts/f/2/c/4/1362609953990473477kitten%2011.jpg" alt="meowing" width="250" height="249" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;8) I want food &ndash; The &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry&rdquo; meow is likely one all cat parents know well. &ldquo;Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it&rsquo;s time for dinner,&rdquo; says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. &ldquo;My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;7) Pay attention to me &ndash; Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention &ndash; and they learn that meowing gets them just that. &ldquo;Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,&rdquo; explains Web MD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;6) Let me in - &ldquo;If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,&rdquo; says Harrell. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn&rsquo;t want to come in &ndash; she just doesn&rsquo;t like having it closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;5) I&rsquo;m in heat &ndash; A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. &ldquo;Another good reason for spaying!&rdquo; she adds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4) I&rsquo;m stressed &ndash; According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.</p>
<p>3) I&rsquo;m ticked off &ndash; &ldquo;Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,&rdquo; says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.</p>
<p>2) I don&rsquo;t want to be alone &ndash; According to The Ohio State University&rsquo;s College of Veterinary Medicine&rsquo;s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.</p>
<p>1) I&rsquo;m getting older &ndash; &ldquo;Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,&rdquo; says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.</p>
<p>Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings. Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.</p>', 22, '2015-05-30 23:28:48.000000')[0m

AND THEIR SHORT-TERM MEMORIES ARE PRETTY GOOD&mdash;UNDER THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES.</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: ''comic sans ms'', sans-serif;">Short-term memories typically fade away in about a minute, but in a study published in<em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">Current Biology</em>&nbsp;in 2007, scientists determined that cats'' short-term memory of certain things lasts 10 minutes. The scientists tested it by stopping cats after their forelegs, but not their hindlegs, had cleared an obstacle. They distracted the cat with food and then waited to see how long the cats would remember having stepped over the obstacle. The cats remembered for about 10 minutes and would&nbsp;<a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #04bfc3; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/08/21/cats-short-term-memory-lasts-about-10-minutes/" target="_blank">bring their hind legs up where they remembered an obstacle</a>, even if it had been removed.</span></p>

"We''ve found that the long-lasting memory for guiding hind legs over an obstacle requires stepping of the forelegs over the obstacle," researcher Keir Pearson of the University of Alberta in Canada said. "The main surprise was how short lasting the visual memory on its own was&mdash;just a few seconds when animals were stopped before their forelegs stepped over the obstacle."</span></p>

"Our data suggest that cats were attracted to ancient farming villages by small animals, such as rodents that were living on the grain that the farmers grew, ate and stored," says Fiona Marshall, study co-author and archaeology professor at Washington University in St. Louis. "Results of this study show that the village of Quanhucun was a source of food for the cats 5300 years ago, and the relationship between humans and cats was commensal, or advantageous for the cats. Even if these cats were not yet domesticated, our evidence confirms that they lived in close proximity to farmers, and that the relationship had mutual benefits."</span></span></p>

<p>According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, &ldquo;cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:</p>
<p>10) I&rsquo;m hurt &ndash; If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat&rsquo;s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn&rsquo;t typical. &ldquo;Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,&rdquo; advises Web MD.</p>
<p>9) I&rsquo;m just saying hi &ndash; Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.<img style="float: left;" src="http://www.clker.com/cliparts/f/2/c/4/1362609953990473477kitten%2011.jpg" alt="meowing" width="250" height="249" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;8) I want food &ndash; The &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry&rdquo; meow is likely one all cat parents know well. &ldquo;Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it&rsquo;s time for dinner,&rdquo; says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. &ldquo;My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;7) Pay attention to me &ndash; Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention &ndash; and they learn that meowing gets them just that. &ldquo;Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,&rdquo; explains Web MD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;6) Let me in - &ldquo;If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,&rdquo; says Harrell. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn&rsquo;t want to come in &ndash; she just doesn&rsquo;t like having it closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;5) I&rsquo;m in heat &ndash; A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. &ldquo;Another good reason for spaying!&rdquo; she adds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4) I&rsquo;m stressed &ndash; According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.</p>
<p>3) I&rsquo;m ticked off &ndash; &ldquo;Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,&rdquo; says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.</p>
<p>2) I don&rsquo;t want to be alone &ndash; According to The Ohio State University&rsquo;s College of Veterinary Medicine&rsquo;s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.</p>
<p>1) I&rsquo;m getting older &ndash; &ldquo;Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,&rdquo; says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.</p>
<p>Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings. Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.</p>', 22, '2015-05-30 23:28:48.000000')

AND THEIR SHORT-TERM MEMORIES ARE PRETTY GOOD&mdash;UNDER THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES.</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: ''comic sans ms'', sans-serif;">Short-term memories typically fade away in about a minute, but in a study published in<em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">Current Biology</em>&nbsp;in 2007, scientists determined that cats'' short-term memory of certain things lasts 10 minutes. The scientists tested it by stopping cats after their forelegs, but not their hindlegs, had cleared an obstacle. They distracted the cat with food and then waited to see how long the cats would remember having stepped over the obstacle. The cats remembered for about 10 minutes and would&nbsp;<a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #04bfc3; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/08/21/cats-short-term-memory-lasts-about-10-minutes/" target="_blank">bring their hind legs up where they remembered an obstacle</a>, even if it had been removed.</span></p>

"We''ve found that the long-lasting memory for guiding hind legs over an obstacle requires stepping of the forelegs over the obstacle," researcher Keir Pearson of the University of Alberta in Canada said. "The main surprise was how short lasting the visual memory on its own was&mdash;just a few seconds when animals were stopped before their forelegs stepped over the obstacle."</span></p>

"Our data suggest that cats were attracted to ancient farming villages by small animals, such as rodents that were living on the grain that the farmers grew, ate and stored," says Fiona Marshall, study co-author and archaeology professor at Washington University in St. Louis. "Results of this study show that the village of Quanhucun was a source of food for the cats 5300 years ago, and the relationship between humans and cats was commensal, or advantageous for the cats. Even if these cats were not yet domesticated, our evidence confirms that they lived in close proximity to farmers, and that the relationship had mutual benefits."</span></span></p>

<p>According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, &ldquo;cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:</p>
<p>10) I&rsquo;m hurt &ndash; If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat&rsquo;s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn&rsquo;t typical. &ldquo;Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,&rdquo; advises Web MD.</p>
<p>9) I&rsquo;m just saying hi &ndash; Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.<img style="float: left;" src="http://www.clker.com/cliparts/f/2/c/4/1362609953990473477kitten%2011.jpg" alt="meowing" width="250" height="249" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;8) I want food &ndash; The &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry&rdquo; meow is likely one all cat parents know well. &ldquo;Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it&rsquo;s time for dinner,&rdquo; says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. &ldquo;My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;7) Pay attention to me &ndash; Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention &ndash; and they learn that meowing gets them just that. &ldquo;Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,&rdquo; explains Web MD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;6) Let me in - &ldquo;If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,&rdquo; says Harrell. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn&rsquo;t want to come in &ndash; she just doesn&rsquo;t like having it closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;5) I&rsquo;m in heat &ndash; A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. &ldquo;Another good reason for spaying!&rdquo; she adds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4) I&rsquo;m stressed &ndash; According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.</p>
<p>3) I&rsquo;m ticked off &ndash; &ldquo;Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,&rdquo; says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.</p>
<p>2) I don&rsquo;t want to be alone &ndash; According to The Ohio State University&rsquo;s College of Veterinary Medicine&rsquo;s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.</p>
<p>1) I&rsquo;m getting older &ndash; &ldquo;Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,&rdquo; says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.</p>
<p>Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings. Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.</p>', 22, '2015-05-30 23:28:48.000000')[0m

AND THEIR SHORT-TERM MEMORIES ARE PRETTY GOOD&mdash;UNDER THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES.</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: ''comic sans ms'', sans-serif;">Short-term memories typically fade away in about a minute, but in a study published in<em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">Current Biology</em>&nbsp;in 2007, scientists determined that cats'' short-term memory of certain things lasts 10 minutes. The scientists tested it by stopping cats after their forelegs, but not their hindlegs, had cleared an obstacle. They distracted the cat with food and then waited to see how long the cats would remember having stepped over the obstacle. The cats remembered for about 10 minutes and would&nbsp;<a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #04bfc3; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/08/21/cats-short-term-memory-lasts-about-10-minutes/" target="_blank">bring their hind legs up where they remembered an obstacle</a>, even if it had been removed.</span></p>

"We''ve found that the long-lasting memory for guiding hind legs over an obstacle requires stepping of the forelegs over the obstacle," researcher Keir Pearson of the University of Alberta in Canada said.

<p>According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, &ldquo;cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:</p>
<p>10) I&rsquo;m hurt &ndash; If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat&rsquo;s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn&rsquo;t typical. &ldquo;Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,&rdquo; advises Web MD.</p>
<p>9) I&rsquo;m just saying hi &ndash; Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.<img style="float: left;" src="http://www.clker.com/cliparts/f/2/c/4/1362609953990473477kitten%2011.jpg" alt="meowing" width="250" height="249" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;8) I want food &ndash; The &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry&rdquo; meow is likely one all cat parents know well. &ldquo;Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it&rsquo;s time for dinner,&rdquo; says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. &ldquo;My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;7) Pay attention to me &ndash; Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention &ndash; and they learn that meowing gets them just that. &ldquo;Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,&rdquo; explains Web MD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;6) Let me in - &ldquo;If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,&rdquo; says Harrell. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn&rsquo;t want to come in &ndash; she just doesn&rsquo;t like having it closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;5) I&rsquo;m in heat &ndash; A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. &ldquo;Another good reason for spaying!&rdquo; she adds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4) I&rsquo;m stressed &ndash; According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.</p>
<p>3) I&rsquo;m ticked off &ndash; &ldquo;Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,&rdquo; says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.</p>
<p>2) I don&rsquo;t want to be alone &ndash; According to The Ohio State University&rsquo;s College of Veterinary Medicine&rsquo;s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.</p>
<p>1) I&rsquo;m getting older &ndash; &ldquo;Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,&rdquo; says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.</p>
<p>Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings. Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.</p>', 22, '2015-05-30 23:28:48.000000')

<p>According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, &ldquo;cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:</p>
<p>10) I&rsquo;m hurt &ndash; If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat&rsquo;s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn&rsquo;t typical. &ldquo;Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,&rdquo; advises Web MD.</p>
<p>9) I&rsquo;m just saying hi &ndash; Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.<img style="float: left;" src="http://www.clker.com/cliparts/f/2/c/4/1362609953990473477kitten%2011.jpg" alt="meowing" width="250" height="249" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;8) I want food &ndash; The &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry&rdquo; meow is likely one all cat parents know well. &ldquo;Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it&rsquo;s time for dinner,&rdquo; says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. &ldquo;My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;7) Pay attention to me &ndash; Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention &ndash; and they learn that meowing gets them just that. &ldquo;Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,&rdquo; explains Web MD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;6) Let me in - &ldquo;If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,&rdquo; says Harrell. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn&rsquo;t want to come in &ndash; she just doesn&rsquo;t like having it closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;5) I&rsquo;m in heat &ndash; A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. &ldquo;Another good reason for spaying!&rdquo; she adds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4) I&rsquo;m stressed &ndash; According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.</p>
<p>3) I&rsquo;m ticked off &ndash; &ldquo;Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,&rdquo; says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.</p>
<p>2) I don&rsquo;t want to be alone &ndash; According to The Ohio State University&rsquo;s College of Veterinary Medicine&rsquo;s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.</p>
<p>1) I&rsquo;m getting older &ndash; &ldquo;Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,&rdquo; says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.</p>
<p>Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings. Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.</p>', 22, '2015-05-30 23:28:48.000000')[0m

AND THEIR SHORT-TERM MEMORIES ARE PRETTY GOOD&mdash;UNDER THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES.</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: ''comic sans ms'', sans-serif;">Short-term memories typically fade away in about a minute, but in a study published in<em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">Current Biology</em>&nbsp;in 2007, scientists determined that cats'' short-term memory of certain things lasts 10 minutes. The scientists tested it by stopping cats after their forelegs, but not their hindlegs, had cleared an obstacle. They distracted the cat with food and then waited to see how long the cats would remember having stepped over the obstacle. The cats remembered for about 10 minutes and would&nbsp;<a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #04bfc3; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/08/21/cats-short-term-memory-lasts-about-10-minutes/" target="_blank">bring their hind legs up where they remembered an obstacle</a>, even if it had been removed.</span></p>

"We''ve found that the long-lasting memory for guiding hind legs over an obstacle requires stepping of the forelegs over the obstacle," researcher Keir Pearson of the University of Alberta in Canada said. "The main surprise was how short lasting the visual memory on its own was&mdash;just a few seconds when animals were stopped before their forelegs stepped over the obstacle."</span></p>

"Our data suggest that cats were attracted to ancient farming villages by small animals, such as rodents that were living on the grain that the farmers grew, ate and stored," says Fiona Marshall, study co-author and archaeology professor at Washington University in St. Louis. "Results of this study show that the village of Quanhucun was a source of food for the cats 5300 years ago, and the relationship between humans and cats was commensal, or advantageous for the cats. Even if these cats were not yet domesticated, our evidence confirms that they lived in close proximity to farmers, and that the relationship had mutual benefits."</span></span></p>

<p>According to Arden Moore, author of The Cat Behavior Answer Book, &ldquo;cats are capable of making at least 30 sounds, including at least 19 variations on the simple meow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So why do cats meow? Check out ten possible translations for cat talk:</p>
<p>10) I&rsquo;m hurt &ndash; If your cat suddenly begins to meow excessively, take him to be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Your cat&rsquo;s meows may indicate that there is something medically wrong, especially if the behavior isn&rsquo;t typical. &ldquo;Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of which can lead to excessive meowing,&rdquo; advises Web MD.</p>
<p>9) I&rsquo;m just saying hi &ndash; Often a cat meows to his human when you come home, says the ASPCA website, or even to greet you when you see each other in the house.<img style="float: left;" src="http://www.clker.com/cliparts/f/2/c/4/1362609953990473477kitten%2011.jpg" alt="meowing" width="250" height="249" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;8) I want food &ndash; The &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry&rdquo; meow is likely one all cat parents know well. &ldquo;Lots of cats know just how to tell their families that it&rsquo;s time for dinner,&rdquo; says pet blogger, Jane Harrell. &ldquo;My cat Mojo would run around after me, meowing the whole time if she thought dinner was going to be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;7) Pay attention to me &ndash; Sometimes cats talk simply because they want your attention &ndash; and they learn that meowing gets them just that. &ldquo;Cats often meow to initiate play, petting or to get you to talk to them,&rdquo; explains Web MD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;6) Let me in - &ldquo;If a door is closed, cats might meow to get you to open it for them,&rdquo; says Harrell. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have a foster cat who meows every time I close the bedroom door. She doesn&rsquo;t want to come in &ndash; she just doesn&rsquo;t like having it closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;5) I&rsquo;m in heat &ndash; A female cat in heat might yowl incessantly, says Moore. &ldquo;Another good reason for spaying!&rdquo; she adds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4) I&rsquo;m stressed &ndash; According to WebMD, cats who are stressed may become more vocal than normal. You may have experienced this first hand with a cat meowing loudly in the car on the way to the vet, for example.</p>
<p>3) I&rsquo;m ticked off &ndash; &ldquo;Angry, agitated cats will often erupt into a screaming match if they feel threatened enough to attack,&rdquo; says Moore. She describes this mad meow sound as more of a yowl.</p>
<p>2) I don&rsquo;t want to be alone &ndash; According to The Ohio State University&rsquo;s College of Veterinary Medicine&rsquo;s Indoor Pet Initiative, when some cats are left alone for lengthy periods of time, they may become anxious and, among other things, meow excessively.</p>
<p>1) I&rsquo;m getting older &ndash; &ldquo;Increased vocalization is fairly common in senior cats,&rdquo; says Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cats and veterinary expert to catchannel.com. As cats age, Dr. Plotnick explains, they may display a decrease in cognitive function, demonstrated in a variety of ways, including loud meowing.</p>
<p>Of course, as any cat parent knows, sometimes cats meow for some unknown reason. Perhaps because the sky is blue or he wants you to change the channel on the television. Since cats can make a variety of vocalizations, your cat will likely use distinctive sounds in different occasions with different meanings. Paying attention to the circumstances in which your cat meows or vocalizes, and the sounds he makes can be fun and help you understand your resident feline a little better.</p>', 22, '2015-05-30 23:28:48.000000')

AND THEIR SHORT-TERM MEMORIES ARE PRETTY GOOD&mdash;UNDER THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES.</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: ''comic sans ms'', sans-serif;">Short-term memories typically fade away in about a minute, but in a study published in<em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">Current Biology</em>&nbsp;in 2007, scientists determined that cats'' short-term memory of certain things lasts 10 minutes. The scientists tested it by stopping cats after their forelegs, but not their hindlegs, had cleared an obstacle. They distracted the cat with food and then waited to see how long the cats would remember having stepped over the obstacle. The cats remembered for about 10 minutes and would&nbsp;<a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #04bfc3; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/08/21/cats-short-term-memory-lasts-about-10-minutes/" target="_blank">bring their hind legs up where they remembered an obstacle</a>, even if it had been removed.</span></p>

"We''ve found that the long-lasting memory for guiding hind legs over an obstacle requires stepping of the forelegs over the obstacle," researcher Keir Pearson of the University of Alberta in Canada said. "The main surprise was how short lasting the visual memory on its own was&mdash;just a few seconds when animals were stopped before their forelegs stepped over the obstacle."</span></p>

"Our data suggest that cats were attracted to ancient farming villages by small animals, such as rodents that were living on the grain that the farmers grew, ate and stored," says Fiona Marshall, study co-author and archaeology professor at Washington University in St. Louis. "Results of this study show that the village of Quanhucun was a source of food for the cats 5300 years ago, and the relationship between humans and cats was commensal, or advantageous for the cats. Even if these cats were not yet domesticated, our evidence confirms that they lived in close proximity to farmers, and that the relationship had mutual benefits."</span></span></p>
